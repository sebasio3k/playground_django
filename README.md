# Playground Django

Backend engineering playground built with Django to explore core framework features, architectural patterns, and best practices in modern web application development.

This repository serves as a sandbox environment for experimenting with authentication, templates, models, middleware, UI integration, and reusable application components.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of Django internals while building reusable patterns that can be applied in production systems.

This includes:

- Application architecture design
- Authentication and session management
- Template composition and reusable components
- Class-based views and routing
- Middleware implementation
- ORM usage and data modeling
- Backend-driven UI systems

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Django 5
- SQLite (development)
- Django Templates
- Bootstrap 5
- Custom CSS (Apple-inspired minimal UI)

---

## Features Implemented

### Core Framework

- URL routing and namespacing
- Function-based and class-based views
- Model definition and ORM usage
- Form handling and validation
- Django Admin configuration

### Authentication

- Login and logout system
- Session management
- Protected views
- User-based content filtering

### Templates

- Template inheritance (`base.html`)
- Includes and reusable components (`header.html`)
- Clean layout architecture

### UI System

- Apple-style minimal UI
- Sticky header with blur effect
- Responsive layout
- Modular styling system

### Middleware

- Custom middleware experimentation
- Request and response interception
